    # Now, you might be asking, where do I go from here?
    # Well, here's a few ideas to get you started:

    # 1. We didn't look at what type of pet we were buying AT ALL
    #    How are you going to make the best lineup possible without having some sort of heuristic for which pet is best?
    #    In the game engine, we have a ton of config listed. You could always leverage that!
    
    # 2. What about the shop foods? Eating food is a quick way to get better pets. AND don't forget about garlic + meat bone

    # 3. We didn't even rearrange our pets! bot_battle.swap_pets() is crucial to making an effective lineup

    # 4. What about rerolling!?!!?! Time to start decided when it is most effective to reroll versus eating food

    # 5. LEVEL YOUR PETS UP! Once you start getting a lineup you like, leveling up a pet can gurantee a victory.

    # This only scratches the surface and there's a lot of clever tricks you can do in the game
